We bring computers, internet, and training to those without so students can do homework, adults can find jobs and manage finances, seniors can connect with loved ones, and all can lead healthier lives.</p>
                      <p class="data-item-text">In the past five years alone, 21,000 learners have graduated from TGH programs, and we have distributed more than 15,000 new computers in communities across Eastern Massachusetts. The coronavirus pandemic along with the growing national consciousness of systematic racism has substantially increased awareness of the digital inequities that low-income households face as many of our school, employment, healthcare and civic programs have moved to virtual platforms.</p>
